# VfAssignment
This is the assignment task of Viral Fission.

Based on the description mentioned, it has feature of Login screen with the api call given. This app follows MVVM architecture with lastest Andorid kotlin libraries and build.


Steps to run:
Import the project in Andorid Studio
Make the emulator or the device connected
Run the project


Explanation:

As the task had minimum description given, based on that I gone through the Viral Fission's website and inspected the layout in mobile mode and made the login UI accordingly.

The issue to replicate the login UI with images was to make the images scroll autoamitcally from API which is fetched from the view model without crashing app.

SO after doing some R&D, I got the solution of using runnable interface to to scroll the images automatically without obsructing or crashing the app.

Also working on Room DB and GoogleAuth integration.

The completed project would be in the github branch:
